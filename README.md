# Java_Project_SocialNetwork

The application implements a simplified social network model. It allows user management, management of friendship relationships between users and message management. I have implemented pagination, the Observer Pattern and ensured data persistence in a PostgreSQL database. The graphical interface is built with JavaFX.
